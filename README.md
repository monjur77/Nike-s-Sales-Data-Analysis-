# Nike-Sales-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

I recently explored the sales data of Nike, and it allowed some really interesting insights! Using Google Looker Studio to turn raw data into informative visualizations with a twist of storytelling.

## ✅ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐝: I input the data in this project from Google Sheets. In these sheets, data have the following columns.

𝐎𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐬: Order Number, Order Date and Order Type.

𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬: Customer Name, City and State.

## 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐬: Product, Category, Cost Per Unit, Selling Price/Unit, Quantity, Cost and Sales Amount.

## 🚀𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:
🎯 𝐓𝐨𝐩-𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐬: Sneakers owned the sales space- about 45% of total revenue.
🎯 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞: California topped the charts with about 30.4% of total sales.
